### Task

1. When you click on the input field, a list of items will appear. ✅
2. As you type, the list should show only items that match what you're typing. ✅
3. Clicking on an item should turn it into a chip at the top, and the input field should adjust automatically. ✅
4. Once an item becomes a chip, it should no longer be in the list. ✅
5. Each chip has an "X" icon. Clicking it removes the chip and adds the item back to the list. ✅

#### Bonus Task

1. Clean code. ✅
2. When the input is blank and the user presses backspace, the last chip (for example, Nick Giannopoulos) should get highlighted and on again pressing backspace it should get deleted. ✅
